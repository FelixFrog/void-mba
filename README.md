# void-mba
Void Linux custom packages for my mba9,1

## Info
What does this repo provide?
 - Kernel 5.12.6 package with bigsur wifi and brcm4377 patches (applied on top of xanmod1-cacule kernel because why not?)
 - Binary packages in releases

It is based off of the awesome work of [https://github.com/aunali1/linux-mbp-arch](https://github.com/aunali1/linux-mbp-arch) and [https://github.com/jamlam/mbp-16.1-linux-wifi](https://github.com/jamlam/mbp-16.1-linux-wifi)

## TODO
 - apple-bce dkms package template/binary
 - compilation tutorial
 - cleaning up x86_64-config-custom

## Disclaimer
This is not meant for general use and reflect what I like. You are probabily goingo to need different patches, .config, etc...
